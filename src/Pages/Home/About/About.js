            <h5>Health is a basic human right. Cordaid wants to ensure that everybody has access to quality health care</h5>
            <h5> Especially women and youth in fragile conflict- and violence-affected settings (FCVAS),  where access or availability of such services is not a given. </h5>
            <h5>We are committed to increase access to sexual and reproductive health services for youth and vulnerable people, like HIV-affected persons. </h5>
            <h5>We contribute to more adequate and more affordable health care services through result-based financing.</h5>
            <h5>We address individual and collective trauma in post-disaster and conflict-affected settings where psychosocial support is a precondition or traumatized people to rebuild their lives.</h5>
            <h5>Our work contributes directly to Sustainable Development Goal 3.</h5>
            <h5>Result-based financing (RBF) and performance-based financing (PBF)  are our guiding approaches to strengthening health systems.</h5>
